Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a classical approach for dimensionality reduction. 
There are different kinds of PCA. Aim of this project is to build a library of different 
PCA approaches, and formulate a better solution for recognition problem. The PCA techniques
called classical PCA, two dimensional PCA (2dPCA),SIMPCA and FLPCA are implemented. The code
is not complete. Need to implement the functions for recognition/classification using neural 
network and some modification of the code. And then have to do the performance measurements.
   
   Here the images from ORL face database is used for training and testing. I have written 
the path to each train images in a file called "train.txt", and the test images in another 
file called "test.txt". The size of the image also fixed, to make the uniformity among images 
(both test and train). The application program, which calls these functions, have to adjust the 
size and type (gray scale) of the image.
